COMBINING JENKINS, TERRAFORM AND ANSIBLE FOR A FULLY AUTOMATED AWS INFRASTRUCTURE.

JENKINS - Jenkins is an open source automation server used for automating the different stages of a software development process. It is primarily used for Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Delivery (CD), and DevOps

I'll be using Jenkins to perform repeated tasks/jobs .eg issuing "ansible playbook command" , "terraform apply" 

jenkins creates a pipeline where repeated tasks are performed one after the other.
eg 
i. provision machines in aws
ii.configure those machines
iii.secure the machines
iv. enabling monitoring for all the news
(one single pipeline can be configured to perform all these tasks one after the other)
