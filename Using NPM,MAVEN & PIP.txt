Introduction to Build Management 

Say you have a simple web application with a front end server and 2 backend servers

eg   


COIT-FRONTEND                         COIT-BACKEND 1                              COIT-BACKEND 2
  JAVASCRIPT                               JAVA                                       PYTHON
      |                                      |                                          |
      |                                      |                                          |
     NPM                                    MAVEN                                      PIP
      |                                      |                                          | 
      |                                      |                                          |
      V                                      V                                          V
package.json(default file)               pom.xml







1.When creating the executable file for JAVASCRIPT
-go into the folder that contains your application code i.e "package.json" file

i. Install NPM
*apt-get update
*apt-get install npm
*npm install                      (downloads all the dependencies and transitive dependencies)
*npm run build                      (builds an exe file ...compile dependencies, source code,images, stylesheets,html to create a working website that the browser will understand)

NB; Default file for NPM is package.json 



BUILDING BACKEND SERVICE 1 USING JAVA

move into folder containing your backend service files
*apt-get update
*apt-get install maven
*mvn install                   (build project, compile source code,download dependecies & create a jar file)
-new folder called "target" will be created containing the jar file.ie "pom.xml"

NB: TO RUN THE JAR FILE, JAVA MUST BE INSTALLED ON THE PC FIRST.


PYTHON PIP {used for installing python modules)
PIP3 is used to read the list of dependencies in the "requirements.txt" and download them
 
FIRST INSTALL PIP3
*apt-get update
*apt-get install python3-pip
*pip3 install -r requirements.txt



RUN ALL THE SOFTWARES AFTER BUILDING THE EXECUTABLE FILES

#PYTHON SHOULD BE INSTALLED BEFORE YOU CAN RUN PYTHON FILES
#JAVA SHOULD BE INSTALLED IF YOU WANT TO RUN JAR FILES 

We'll begin with python pip3 {ie backend service 2}

  RUNNING THE BACKEND SERVICE-2
1.You should have python installed
2. go into folder container python program(i.e backend -2 service)
3. go into the sa folder    {cd sa}
4.run this command... python3 <programname.py
*python3 sentiment_analysis.py


 RUNNING THE JAR FILE (BACKEND SERVICE-1)
1.Install JAVA first if you dont have it already installed
2.Move into folder containing the "backend-1 service"
3.Move into the "target" folder which contains the "jar file"
4. Run java -jar <nameofjarfile.jar>
*java -jar sentiment-analysis-web-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar 




RUNNING THE FRONTEND SERVICE (JAVASCRIPT)

1.Go into directory containing your frontend service(frontend service)
2.install apache 2
*apt-get update
*apt-get install apache2
-locate default apache folder /var/www//html and delete index.html file (rm index.html)
-copy frontend app file to /var/www/html    to display contents of your frontend service
